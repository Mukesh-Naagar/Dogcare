				<li><b>Teach them their name -</b> It's going to be hard to teach your puppy how to do anything if they don't know when they're supposed to look ar you.Whenever your puppy is looking away, say their name if they lok at you even if its' just because you made noise give them a treat and some praise. Don't use any nicknames early on. You want to use the same exact name every time you do this to keep this process simple.</li>
				<li><b>Teach a dog to sit -</b> Sy sit and gently raise the treat over their head a little further.Your dog should follow the treat up and enter a sitting position so they cab track the treat more comfortably. if they sit down give them the treat. if they dont' pull back and wait for them to settle down before trying again.</li>
				<li><b>Teach a dog to lie -</b> When they reach to get the treat slowly lower it down towards the ground. Your dog should start folowing the treat to te floor.While they're doing this, say down or lay down if they lie down give them the treat. if they don't raise the treat back up and try again As they get bettr stop moving the treat.</li>
				<li><b>Teach a dog to stay -</b> You can use stop stay or whatever command you'd like wait a few seconds. if your dog stays still give them the treat. Repeat this process over and over again increasing the length of time between the command and the reward as you continue working on this get them to stay and them ty backing up away from the dog.</li>
				<li><b>Dog to come to me -</b> If they walk over to you gie them a treat. Then leave a treat on the ground and walk away as soon as they finish the treat on the ground say come and gesture again Reeat this ve and over again to get it to stick you can even play around by moving all over you home in between the floor treats to keep things fun and interesiting.</li>

				<li><b>Brushing -</b> Among the most important tools for a new puppy owner are the comb and the brush.Start grooming your puppy at an early age.</li>
				<li><b>Bathing -</b> You don't have to bathe your puppy regularly.However,if he's rolled in some particularly aromatic dirt a nice warm bath is a good idea.Use dog shamoo for this purpose.</li>
				<li><b>Eyes and Ears -</b> You'll want to regularly check your pet's eyes for any tearing crust, cloudiness or inflammation that may indicate a health problem. Face your pet in a brightly lit area and look into their eyes. They sholuld be clear and bright, and the area around the eyball should be whte.</li>
				<li><b>Skincare Routine -</b> The condition of your cat or dog's skin is an indication of her overall health. When a skin problem occurs, your pet may resond with excessive sratching, chewing and licking. A wide range of causes-including external parasites and allergies to seasonal changes and stress, or a combination of these may be to blame.Skin problems are one of the most common reasons pet parents seek veterinary care.</li>
				<li><b>Trim -</b> While it's safe to lightly trim your pet's hair, we advise that you NEVER shave your pet, When trimming at home trim dry clean fur around the face, feet and tail. Be very carefull with your scissors and when trimming around the ears, use your free hand to hold the ear to make sure you only trim the excess.</li>
